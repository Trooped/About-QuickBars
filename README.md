### 👨‍💻 Project Motivation

The inspiration for QuickBars came from a very personal place. My dad has difficulty seeing things up close, which made using a phone to control our smart home a challenge. I wanted him to experience the power of Home Assistant, so I set out to build a solution that was big, clear, and intuitive enough for him to use from the couch.

What I quickly discovered is a classic principle of good design: by solving for that specific accessibility need, I had created a faster, more convenient, and more seamless experience for *all* users, including myself. This project became a passion-fueled endeavor to build a product that is not only powerful, but truly accessible and enjoyable for everyone in the shared TV experience.
